# Elements Of Progamming Interviews
### The above book by Adnan Aziz, Amit Prakash, and Tsung-Hsien Lee was originally for solving interview-style problems in Java. 
### The problems are great, but what I really wanted was a book to reference while studying that had solutions and explanations in Javascript.
### So this repo is just me making it myself as I go along!
